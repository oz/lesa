# Lesa

Lesa is an experimental node.js project to build yet another feed reader, for
the terminal. At the moment, this is mainly a Feedly client because this is
what I use daily, but a decent program should be able to synchronize with more
sources (or even no sources at all mind you).

It is built on node.js, because [blessed][blessed] is less painful than curses
or the other [termbox][termbox] things, and I felt like writing some JS during
lunch breaks.

Lesa is icelandish for *read*.
