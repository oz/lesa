# Lesa

Lesa is an experimental node.js project to build yet another feed reader for
the terminal. At the moment, this is mainly a Feedly client because this is
what I use daily, but the program should be able to synchronize with more
sources, or even no sources at all mind you.

It is build on top of node.js, because [blessed][blessed] is less painful than
curses or the other [termbox][termbox] things, and Javascript is actually OK
without a browser.

Lesa is icelandish for *read*.

Install with `npm i lesa`.
